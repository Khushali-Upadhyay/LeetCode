Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.
Follow up: Could you implement a solution using only O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) runtime complexity?


class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums):
        num_set = set(nums)
        n = len(nums) + 1
        for number in range(n):
            if number not in num_set:
                return number
